# High-Energy-Detectors---Final-Code
- Main.py file is for the user to run and get the output files as needed.
- The repository has the scripts for all the three detectors seperate and a Main script which is for the user to access and to get the output value needed
- Main.py file is the compilation of all the three detector scripts attached.
- User can run the Main script and get to select what detector type needed and the output is given as chosen.
- NAI_detector_code - file has the script for all the curve fit, Callibrtion, Resolution, efficiency and Off axis calculation for the all the calculation done using the reading taken from NaI detector in laboratory.
- BGO_detector_code - file has the script for all the curve fit, Callibrtion, Resolution, efficiency and Off axis calculation for the all the calculation done using the reading taken from BGO detector in laboratory.
- CDTE_detector_code - file has the script for all the curve fit, Callibrtion, Resolution, efficiency and Off axis calculation for the all the calculation done using the reading taken from CdTe detector in laboratory.
